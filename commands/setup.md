# Sound FX Setup

You are configuring the Sound FX plugin for Claude Code. This plugin plays themed sound effects in response to Claude Code events (session start, prompt submit, task complete, error, notification, context compact, session end).

Available themes (12 total):
- **Sci-Fi & AI**: Jarvis (Iron Man), GLaDOS (Portal), Star Trek, Optimus Prime (Transformers)
- **Anime**: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, One Piece (Luffy), Pikachu, Doraemon
- **Gaming & Other**: WoW Peon, StarCraft SCV, Steve Jobs, Mechanical Keyboard

## Instructions

1. Read the current config file at `~/.claude/sound-fx.local.json` (it may not exist yet). Note the current settings if any.

2. **Ask Question 1 — Action** using AskUserQuestion:
   - header: "Action"
   - question: "What would you like to do?"
   - multiSelect: false
   - options:
     - label: "Configure (Recommended)", description: "Set up or change your sound effects theme and trigger mode"
     - label: "Update", description: "Re-apply current settings, refresh hooks, and play a test sound"
     - label: "Remove", description: "Completely remove sound effects — deletes configuration file"

3. **If user chose "Update"**:
   - Read the config at `~/.claude/sound-fx.local.json`.
   - If the file does not exist or is empty, tell the user no configuration found and suggest choosing "Configure" instead. Stop here.
   - If config exists, display the current settings summary:
     - Theme: (theme name or "mix")
     - Trigger mode: (full or minimal)
     - Enabled: (true or false)
   - Re-write the same config back to `~/.claude/sound-fx.local.json` (to ensure file integrity).
   - Play a test sound:
     ```bash
     bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/hook.sh start
     ```
   - Confirm: "Settings verified and hooks refreshed. Everything is working!"
   - **Stop here** (do not continue to further steps).

4. **If user chose "Remove"**:
   - Delete the config file:
     ```bash
     rm -f ~/.claude/sound-fx.local.json
     ```
   - Confirm: "Sound effects have been completely removed. Configuration file deleted."
   - Tell the user: "Run `/sound-fx:setup` anytime to set up sound effects again."
   - **Stop here** (do not continue to further steps).

5. **If user chose "Configure"**, ask **Question 2 — Mode**:
   - header: "Mode"
   - question: "How would you like sound effects configured?"
   - multiSelect: false
   - options:
     - label: "Single Theme (Recommended)", description: "Choose one specific theme to use exclusively"
     - label: "Mix", description: "All 12 themes randomly mixed for maximum variety"
     - label: "Disable All Sounds", description: "Turn off all sound effects"

6. **If user chose "Disable All Sounds"**: Write config and skip to step 12:
   ```json
   {"enabled": false}
   ```

7. **If user chose "Single Theme"**, ask **Question 3 — Theme Group**:
   - header: "Theme"
   - question: "Which theme group?"
   - multiSelect: false
   - options:
     - label: "Jarvis / GLaDOS / Trek / Optimus", description: "Sci-Fi & AI voices and interface sounds"
     - label: "JoJo / One Piece / Pikachu / Doraemon", description: "Anime character voice lines"
     - label: "Peon / SCV / Steve Jobs / Keyboard", description: "Gaming sounds, inspirational voice, ASMR"

8. **Then ask Question 4 — Theme** based on the chosen group:

   If "Jarvis / GLaDOS / Trek / Optimus":
   - header: "Theme"
   - question: "Which theme?"
   - options:
     - label: "Jarvis", description: "Iron Man JARVIS AI assistant — voice with sci-fi UI effects"
     - label: "GLaDOS", description: "Portal's passive-aggressive AI with dark humor"
     - label: "Star Trek", description: "Classic starship interface beeps and chirps"
     - label: "Optimus Prime", description: "Transformers commander — heroic voice with effects"

   If "JoJo / One Piece / Pikachu / Doraemon":
   - header: "Theme"
   - question: "Which theme?"
   - options:
     - label: "JoJo", description: "DIO and Jotaro iconic voice lines from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure"
     - label: "One Piece", description: "Monkey D. Luffy's energetic voice lines"
     - label: "Pikachu", description: "Pikachu's signature expressions"
     - label: "Doraemon", description: "Doraemon iconic robot cat voice"

   If "Peon / SCV / Steve Jobs / Keyboard":
   - header: "Theme"
   - question: "Which theme?"
   - options:
     - label: "WoW Peon", description: "'Ready to work!' — Warcraft Peon worker sounds"
     - label: "StarCraft SCV", description: "'SCV good to go, sir!' — StarCraft worker sounds"
     - label: "Steve Jobs", description: "Inspirational voice with background effects"
     - label: "Mechanical Keyboard", description: "Satisfying mechanical keyboard ASMR sounds"

   Map theme names to directory names:
   - "Jarvis" → "jarvis", "GLaDOS" → "glados", "Star Trek" → "trek", "Optimus Prime" → "optimus"
   - "JoJo" → "jojo", "One Piece" → "onepiece", "Pikachu" → "pikachu", "Doraemon" → "doraemon"
   - "WoW Peon" → "peon", "StarCraft SCV" → "scv", "Steve Jobs" → "jobs", "Mechanical Keyboard" → "keyboard"

9. **Preview the selected theme** — play a random sound so the user can hear it before committing:
   - Tell the user: "Playing a preview of [Theme Display Name]..."
   - Write a temporary config to preview the theme, then trigger hook.sh:
     ```bash
     printf '{"theme": "<directory_name>", "mode": "full", "enabled": true}' > ~/.claude/sound-fx.local.json
     bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/hook.sh start
     ```
     (Replace `<directory_name>` with the mapped directory name from step 8)

10. **Ask confirmation** using AskUserQuestion:
   - header: "Confirm"
   - question: "How does [Theme Display Name] sound?"
   - multiSelect: false
   - options:
     - label: "Keep it", description: "Use this theme and continue setup"
     - label: "Try another", description: "Go back and pick a different theme"

   If the user chose "Try another": **go back to step 7** and repeat the theme group → theme → preview → confirm loop.
   If the user chose "Keep it": continue to step 11.

11. **Ask Trigger Mode** (for both Mix and Single Theme):
   - header: "Trigger"
   - question: "How often should sounds play?"
   - multiSelect: false
   - options:
     - label: "Full (Recommended)", description: "All 7 events: start, submit, complete, error, notification, compact, session end"
     - label: "Minimal", description: "Essential only: start, complete, error, notification"

   Map: "Full" → "full", "Minimal" → "minimal"

12. **Write the config** to `~/.claude/sound-fx.local.json`:

   For Mix mode:
   ```json
   {"theme": "mix", "mode": "<full|minimal>", "enabled": true}
   ```

   For Single Theme:
   ```json
   {"theme": "<directory_name>", "mode": "<full|minimal>", "enabled": true}
   ```

   For Disable:
   ```json
   {"enabled": false}
   ```

13. **Confirm** the setup is complete. Show a summary:
   - Mode: Mix / Single (theme name) / Disabled
   - Trigger: Full / Minimal (if applicable)
   - Tell the user they can re-run `/sound-fx:setup` anytime to change settings.

14. **Play a test sound** (skip if Disabled):
   ```bash
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/hook.sh start
   ```

15. **Platform check** — detect the environment and provide guidance if needed:
   ```bash
   uname -s
   ```
   - If the output is **Darwin**: no further setup needed.
   - If the output is **Linux**: run this check to see if audio will work locally:
     ```bash
     command -v paplay >/dev/null 2>&1 || command -v ffplay >/dev/null 2>&1 || command -v aplay >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "LOCAL_AUDIO_OK" || echo "NO_LOCAL_AUDIO"
     ```
     - If **LOCAL_AUDIO_OK**: tell the user "Audio player detected — sounds will play directly on this machine. No extra setup needed."
     - If **NO_LOCAL_AUDIO**: check for WSL:
       ```bash
       grep -qi microsoft /proc/version 2>/dev/null && echo "WSL" || echo "HEADLESS"
       ```
       - If **WSL**: check for Windows-side players:
         ```bash
         command -v ffplay.exe >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "WSL_AUDIO_OK" || echo "WSL_NO_AUDIO"
         ```
         - If **WSL_AUDIO_OK**: tell the user "ffplay.exe detected via WSL — sounds will play through Windows. No extra setup needed."
         - If **WSL_NO_AUDIO**: tell the user "ffplay.exe not found. Install FFmpeg on Windows (`winget install Gyan.FFmpeg`) or sounds will be silent."
       - If **HEADLESS** (remote server, no audio): tell the user:
         "This appears to be a remote/headless server with no audio output. To hear sounds, set up the relay on your **local machine**:
         1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/6m1w/claude-sound-fx`
         2. Start relay: `python3 claude-sound-fx/scripts/relay.py &`
         3. SSH with port forwarding: `ssh -R 19876:127.0.0.1:19876 this-server`"
